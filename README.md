# glTF Viewer with a Simplified User Interface 

Preview glTF 2.0 models in WebGL using three.js and a drag-and-drop interface. 

This version has a simplified and re-organised user interface for a specific use and some new .exr backgrounds. Background visibility can be activated easier, when it is moved right below the Lighting HDRI environment selection. Also a - **_Help_** - section has been added to inform users how to use the mouse controls. 

Original Viewer: [gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/)
